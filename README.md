# bankersAlgorithm
This is an example of using the Banker's Algorithm to determine the safe state of an operating system. Should the system end up in a safe state, the algorithm will print out a safe sequence for the process to execute with their resources properly allocated. Given the variables placed in the text files, the output will always be in a safe state and output a safe sequence, but modifiying the variables and .txt files will change the output

Project coded in C++

Examples of Output:

1. System is not safe

  The system is not in a safe state


2. System is safe

  System in a Safe State!
  
  Safe Sequence: P1, P4, P2, P0, P3
